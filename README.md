# Functioning-Roblox-Phone
Working phone developed in Roblox Studio with working call/receiving w/ chat filtering, notes, music w/ settings, etc. Specifically made for the Roblox metaverse, and is compatible in any Roblox game/experience.

**The development for this project began in Feb 15, 2020, and concluded on December 15, 2020.**

The source code uploaded to GitHub is only to display the organization and structure of the .LUA source code written for the project. There are also several Roblox assets being used, such as UI/UX elements, image/audio assets, 3D model assets, etc. that were not able to be uploaded to GitHub due to their incompatible formats. The complete Roblox model is uploaded (as a .rbxm file), and can be simply imported to Roblox Studio for use. As stated earlier, the entire phone model is also available on the Roblox Assets Library in the link provided above.
